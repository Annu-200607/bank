🖥️ How the System Works

The frontend provides a clean banking dashboard.

Users can perform deposit, withdrawal, and balance enquiry in real time.

The C program implements the same banking operations using:

Structures to store account details

Functions for each banking operation

Switch-case for menu handling

This separation improves clarity and understanding.

▶️ How to Run the Project
🔹 Run the UI (Frontend)

Download or clone the repository

Open index.html in any modern browser

Use the banking system dashboard

🔹 Run the C Program (Backend)
gcc bank.c -o bank
./bank
